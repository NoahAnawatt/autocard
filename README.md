You need to have ollama installed and running in the background on your machine to run this. Ollama is a locally run llm handler. You will need to install a model (the default is `llama3:8b`). 

The textCapture tool copies text you highlight to a file. This is how I extract zybooks content.

Run autocard.py like this:
```
python3 autocard.py [textbook] [flashcards file]
```
